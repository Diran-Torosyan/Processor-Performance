This project was meant to be a cache management system written in C
there would be 4 inputs that the program would take in
1. Number of instruction classes
2. CPI of each instruction type
3. Total instruction count of each type of instruction
4. clock rate of machine
From there the program would output a table of parameters, that would include all of the inputs
then it will create a table fo performance, calculating the Average CPI, CPU time in milliseconds, and the MIPS of each instruction class
